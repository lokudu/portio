I'll always be grateful to Brian for inviting me to his party last night because meeting you became the highlight of my evening. I'm also grateful he was willing to pass you this note in his English Lit. Class. I hope that you remember me. I was the one with the buzz cut and my mind was on the tests we're running in my statistics class.
